## How to Run

Each exercise is a standalone Go program. To run any file, use:

```sh
go run <filename.go>
```

For example:

```sh
go run first.go
```

## Purpose

These exercises cover:

- Basic syntax and printing
- Variables, constants, and data types
- Control flow (if, for, switch)
- Functions and error handling
- Arrays, slices, maps, and structs
- Pointers and methods
- Interfaces and polymorphism
- Anonymous functions and closures
- Concurrency: goroutines, channels, select
